Service analytics also covers process analytics and will be useful for those who are managing processes and quality in service industries. The methodologies taught in this course are applicable to many industries including IT Services, public services (e.g. Government agencies), Healthcare, Finance Institutions (Retail Banking & Insurance), Airlines, Logistics, Transport, Hotel, Tourism, Consumer services, etc.  An organisation’s innovation potential depends on its capability to process ‘data’ about internal operations and the world outside the organization. The scope of this analytics-based capability is constantly expanded by the development of new technologies making the generation, collection, and analysis of data much easier. For many industries, more data and the ability to analyse that data in a scientific manner, provide an opportunity to optimise, innovate, and differentiate for growth and greater efficiency. This capability based on data analytics is emerging as a critical factor to achieve competitive advantage. This course is part of the Data Science  and Graduate Certificate in Advanced Predictive Modelling Techniques Series offered by NUS-ISS.','At the end of the course, the participants will be able to: Recognise, access, and utilise different types of service data. Understand and apply different sense making and data communication techniques.Evaluate, select, and implement specific analytic tools.Design and deploy analytical frameworks for ‘service quality’, ‘customer satisfaction’, and ‘service innovation’.

One good way to improve this situation is to make use of Lean IT best practices.Lean IT is the extension of Lean principles applied to IT products and services. Lean IT can be interpreted as an IT process improvement strategy; a way to design, transform and run the IT business so as to maximise customer value and reduce waste. It focuses on improving value, efficiency and speed, through reduction of waste within the value delivery processes of an IT organisation.  The Lean concept has a great impact on the culture of an organisation as it empowers employees to participate in the optimisation of processes. The principles of Lean IT are applicable to all organisations with IT operations regardless of industry or sector.Lean IT is complementary to other frameworks and methods such as ITIL®, PMP®, CMMI® and COBIT®. These frameworks provide guidelines on best-practice processes but do not provide much guidance on how the implementation details of the processes can be optimised to reduce waste and increase value to the customer/user. Lean IT provides this complementary aspect.  Lean IT is also complementary to agile methods such as SCRUM. For example, SCRUM recommends reflecting on completed SCRUM processes for improvement (e.g. via sprint retrospective) but SCRUM does not give much guidance on how to improve. Again, Lean IT provides this complementary aspect.Lean companies are arguably more successful than non-lean companies in terms of business value and retaining talent, and their success is more sustainable over time.This course teaches Lean IT Foundation principles and concepts. Class exercises, workshops and quiz are used extensively to reinforce the participants understanding and practice of the concepts as well as assess the competence of the participants. The course also includes the Lean IT Foundation Exam which leads to the Lean IT Foundation Certificate for successful participants.The 60-minute, 40 questions, multiple-choice Lean IT Foundation certificate exam is scheduled on the last day of the course.Upon completion of this course, participants would be able to:Broaden their skills on process improvement with a strong emphasis on focusing on value as seen from the customer’s perspectiveMinimising waste and producing more efficient IT services, which in turn benefits the organisationThis course is part of the  Digital Agility Series offered by NUS-ISS.Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 14.5 PDUs (PM: 10.5, Leadership: 2, Business: 2) that can be used to maintain your PMP® credential.

An Agile framework, such as Scrum, is an iterative approach for software development, where requirements and designs evolve through collaboration between the customer and self-organising project teams.Agile Testing focuses on identifying and repairing defects when they are detected, rather than waiting for a later stage in the project. By doing so, the products quality will increase and development costs and efforts will go down. Agile practices, such as daily meetings can help to identify issues and defects early.This three-day course will provide training and testing activities related to Agile projects and on applying tools and techniques to ensure that software products meet the accepted quality level (AQL).Advantages of Agile Testing:Improves qualitySaves time and moneyReduces documentationTeam gets regular feedback from end usersThis course is part of the Software Systems series and Digital Agility series offered by NUS-ISS.','At the end of the course, the participants will be able to:Understand the mindset, culture and principles behind the Agile approach to software developmentDifferentiate between the testing role in Agile teams compared to that in traditional teamsContribute positively as an Agile team member focused on Agile testingRecognise the challenges and difficulties associated with non-testing activities performed in an Agile teamUnderstand and apply the following within an Agile project: Test estimation, test planning, test design (Test Driven Development and Behavior-Driven Development), test execution, defect management and test closureSupport the teams accountability for qualityDemonstrate a range of soft skills required by effective Agile team members','It is applicable for professionals engaged in the following areas:Members of software development teams who wish to increase their effectiveness in performing testing activities within an Agile framework, such as Scrum, including:    Product OwnersBusiness AnalystsSolution ArchitectsScrum MastersSoftware DevelopersProject stakeholders who need to understand how testing is performed within an Agile framework, such as Scrum, including:    Programme ManagersProject ManagersQuality ManagersPre-RequisitesParticipants must possess at least two years of IT working experienceNoteParticipants are required to bring their own internet enabled computing device (laptops, tablet etc) & power charger to access and download electronic courseware in PDF format.

Agile organisations that are effective are both stable (resilient, reliable and efficient) and dynamic (fast, nimble and adaptive). Research shows that stability and dynamism are significant catalysts for organisational health and performance. Agile organisations also appear to be better at innovation, according to the best research.This course will present the importance of business agility in relation to digital transformation and provide guidance on extending Agile practices across the organisation. A proven approach for establishing an Agile organisational culture will be discussed.

BizOps caters to an agile/lean process for business needs that are directly catered for by IT infra/ops and IT/project managers without involvement of software developers.  These can be new services (e.g. implementation of new infra such as IoT sensor network), upgrade of existing services (e.g. upgrade of wifi network) and work relating to existing services (e.g. service requests, incident management etc.) While most DevOps courses touch indirectly on BizOps, this course will explicitly cover BizOps in addition to DevOps so as to provide a coverage of lean/agile across all IT services and the roles that all the different IT management/specialists play in it as well as tools that are important to such agility.As DevOps and BizOps do not have a widely-recognised, de-facto certification body or international standard as yet, this course captures and integrates international best practices from the industry (e.g. from companies such as Spotify) so as to provide useful and practical foundational competencies in DevOps and BizOps.You will earn 17.5 PDUs (Technical : 17.5) upon successful completion of this course.
