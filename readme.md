## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Singapore, as a nation, has been emerging as one of the smartest on Earth. The rapid advancements in digital technologies and the unfolding digital revolution has changed the way its inmates live work and play. The economy of Singapore is looking forward for more digital innovation techniques which can be incorporated in all the sectors in order to enhance itself. As mentioned in smartnation.sg few of the notable projects undertaken are as follows: Personal alert button trials, SGQR payment standards, use of bank cards for public transport, payment services bill, etc.,
As reported by Straitstimes, there were three major issues prevailing in this country as addressed by the Prime minister. One amongst them being handling big data to provide better public services. He also added that the aim of this nation is to have a digitally literate society for competing with the emerging cashless countries. Therefore, it is important to enhance the skills of people who are employed in the digital and the IT sector in order to achieve this goal.

The Institute of System Sciences at the National University of Singapore targets in developing Information technology and Communication leaders that drive business and organisation innovation. It offers a wide variety of programmes suitable for employed people who wish to sharpen their skills in data science, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity etc., Working people can gain knowledge and at the same time earn Professional Development Units (PDU) and showcase their skills in the digital industry.
The “ISS-Course Recommender” project intends to cater the appropriate course for its user based on the details specified in their resume and the proficiency which they wish to inculcate in themselves. The system consists of a user interface in the form of a web page which encourages users to enter their resumes. Additionally, it also provides them with an application form wherein they can mention their details and their known and interested skills. The page then takes them through the main list of programmes available at ISS and asks the user to choose from. Once the user has made the selection, it puts forward a list of sub programmes and its description. Once the necessary choices are picked up, the user is acknowledged with the schedule of the selected course.
